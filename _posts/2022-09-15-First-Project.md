## Introduction to Functions in R

*  ##  What was the purpose of the project?
      
      This is the first project of the Data science course and it is about wirting functions in R . The goal of this project was to create functions that will take certain 
       form of data sets and automatically return plots.
     
 * ##  What did you learn?
 
      First, I learned that coding is not a sprint, but rather a marathon. It takes time, dedication, and effort. There will be times when you will be stuck on a particular
       task for hours, especially if you are new to the material. In those cases, platforms like Google, Stackoverflow, and whatnot will be your best friend. Getting some hints
       from your TA, professor or even classmates can also be very helpful and should not be underestimated. 
       
      Second, coding is analogous to a logic game, simply because it requires good logic. There are many ways of writing algorithms and different people often use different 
       techniques to get the same answer. It all comes down to whose logic is simpler, straigthforward , more redable or interpretable. Just like Mathematics, coding is also
       a problem solving discipline and debugging a buggy code can be as stubborn as finding your way through a really abstract Math problem.
       
      Finally, I learned that functions are a good way of saving time, in the sense that it prevents us from the copy/paste routine. A single wrapper function that can be used 
       on many data sets is better than writting new functions for every new data set.
       
 * ## How did you feel you did on this first project?
 
      Honestly, I did not do well on this first project. While trying to juggle my other courses and work, I started this project late and did not give my best.
      I was stuck on some parts and could not get some answers. I was still working on the project until the due date and couldn't even write narrattions as required
      by the professor. I am hoping, maybe he will be lenient overall when grading this first project.
      
 * ## What would you do differently?
 
      For the next project, I will definetely start early and take my time to write better code. Also, rather than starting the project directly in R, I will start by 
      writing the algorithms down in a notebook and possibly catch the flaws in my logic. 
      
      One thing that I also found helpful was to leave the task, when stuck and come back to it after some walk or after some other activities. 
      
 * ## What are your final thoughts or words?
 
      I will not give up :)
