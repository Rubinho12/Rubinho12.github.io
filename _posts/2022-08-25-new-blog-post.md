## Data Science and Statistics

* What do you think being a data scientist is about?

    Data science is born from the fusion of two sciences which are Statistics and Computer science. A data scientist is someone who collects data,
    cleans it, analyzes it and makes insights from it. The tools that a data scientist uses to perform those tasks are mainly applied statistics and coding
    or computer programming. Data scientists work in different sectors where, in addition to their technical skills, have to also possess specific domain knowledge 
    in order to be  well-rounded scientists.
    
    Data analysts might be tempted to call themselves data scientists since they have been using statistics and programming in their careers. While this is 
    partially right, they are not quite data scientists. A data scientist job is not only limited to using statistics and coding, however they are also deeply
    involved in building various statistical and mathematical models which require knowledge of a wide variety of machine or statistical learning techniques, plus 
    some advanced statistics and mathematics.
    
* What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

    The first and most crucial duty of a data scientist is to be able to effectively manipulate data. By manipulating data, I mean collect data, clean the data, transform
    it and get it ready for analysis. We can talk to thousands of data scientists and they will all assure us that 80% of their jobs actually involves cleaning the data
    and getting it ready.
    
    The next task is getting into exploratory data analysis, looking for trends, building models, and presenting or communicating the results, also known as data 
    storytelling.
    
    For the knowledge required, an ideal data scientist must have a strong background in Probality and Statistics, Linear Algebra and Matrices, Bayesian Statistics,
    Time Series Analysis; and also have strong programming skills in languages such as R, Python, SAS. A data scientist must be comfortable wotking with tools like
    SQL, Hadoop, Tableau etc...
    
* What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
    
    Both statisticians and data sientists have a common knowledge of statistics and statistical programming languages. Some even argue that data scientists are just
    rebranded statisticians. I, honestly , do not see much differences between the two professions besides the amount of coding that is involved in each one. For a 
    long time ago, statisticians have been able to get away with less coding, however things are now changing fast and with the exponential rise of computers and 
    technology, a great statistician must be able to get his/her hands dirty with lots of coding, just like data scientists.
    
    Note, nevertheless, that in research oriented areas, statistcians will get more theoretical while data scientists will be concerned with the applied side of things.
    
* How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
    
    Having a background in Mathematics and an advanced degree in Statistics, that involves a lot of coding, I can definitely see myself working as either a 
    statistician or a data scientist. I have the necessary skills to thrive in both careers and with perpetual learning I can hopefullly become an expert.
