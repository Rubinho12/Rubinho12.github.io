Hi there and welcome to my blog! My name is **Ruben Sowah** , and I am a graduate student studying **Statistics and Applied Mathematics** at __North Carolina State University__. Growing up, I was always fascinated by the beauty of Mathematics and how precise and true it can be. However, not wanting to dwell in its *abstract* world, I found the applied side of Maths directly more impactful and useful to solve current problems in our society.
