Hi there and welcome to my blog! My name is Ruben Sowah , and I am a graduate student styudying Statistics and Applied Mathematics at North Carolina State University.
Growing up, I was always fascinated by the beauty of Mathematics and how precise and true it can be. However, not wanting to live in its abstract world, I found the 
applied side of Maths directly more impactful and useful to solve current problems in our society.
