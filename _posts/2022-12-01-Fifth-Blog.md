## Let's talk career.  

## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course? 
  This course has provided me with an excellent R programming skils. Not ony did I learn a lot about R, but I also learned quite much about statistics.
   Tidyverse, code automation, ideal exploratory data analysis, statistical learning, the use of github are just some of the many skills that are transferable
   in today's data world. This class is set up in a way that enables the student to work hard and push him/herself in order to get great results, a skill that
   is very fruitful in practice.  
   
## What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career?  
  In my future career , I can see myself analyzing data, using statistical literacy and data science skills to build statistical and/or mathematical 
  models. 
  
## What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about?  
  I am interested in learning more about the statistical or machine learning field. I am fascinated about predictive modelling, forecasting of data and whatnot.
  A fact about me is that taking a linear regression elective as a Math major in college was the incentive that galvanized me to study statistics in graduate school. 
  It was just interesting, therefore I hope to get more knowledge in this area.
