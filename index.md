Hi there and welcome to my blog! My name is **Ruben Sowah** , and I am a graduate student studying **Statistics and Applied Mathematics** at North Carolina State University. Growing up, I was always fascinated by the beauty of Mathematics and how precise and true it can be. However, not wanting to live in its abstract world, I found the applied side of Maths directly more impactful and useful to solve current problems in our society.
